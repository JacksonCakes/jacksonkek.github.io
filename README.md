Welcome to my personal blog repository! This repository contains the content for my personal website, where I share various articles, tutorials, and thoughts on a wide range of topics. Feel free to explore the content and visit my blog here.

### Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

**_posts<**: This directory contains the published articles and blog posts. Each post is stored as a separate markdown file, following a specific naming convention to ensure proper sorting and categorization.

**_drafts**: In this directory, you'll find the work-in-progress drafts of upcoming posts. These drafts are not yet ready for publishing but give you a glimpse into what's coming up.

**_images**: All the images used in the blog posts are stored in this directory. They are referenced within the markdown files to enhance the visual experience.

**_templates**: This directory contains reusable templates and components used in the blog posts. It helps maintain consistency and saves time when creating new content.

**_config.yml**: The configuration file for the Jekyll static site generator, which powers my personal website. It includes various settings for customization, such as site title, theme selection, and navigation.
